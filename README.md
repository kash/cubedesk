# CubeDesk
[CubeDesk](https://cubedesk.io) is a free, open-source application that allows [speedcubers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing) to keep track of their times, visualize their stats, train hundreds of algorithms, and play with other cubers.

## Bugs & Feature Requests
Before creating a bug or asking for a new feature, it's worthwhile to bring up your request on the Discord Server, where you may be able to get your issue resolved. If you'd like to report a bug, though, please go to the [Issues page](https://github.com/kash/cubedesk/issues) and create a New Issue with the `bug` label.

If you'd like to request a new feature or make suggestions, please use the [Discussions page](https://github.com/kash/cubedesk/discussions).

## Development
If you'd like to contribute to CubeDesk, firstly, *thank you*; secondly, please follow the [Development Onboarding instructions on the Wiki](https://github.com/kash/cubedesk/wiki/Development-Onboarding). Getting set up should only take less than 10 minutes!

## Support
CubeDesk is completely free to use, but, unfortunately, the cloud isn't. If you'd like to support CubeDesk, consider getting a [Pro membership](https://www.cubedesk.io/account/pro). You'll get tons of cool features and you'll be supporting development as well.
